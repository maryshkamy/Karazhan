## üîí Authentication

>*"The Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Its most notable applications are remote login and command-line execution."* [Secure Shell on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)

You can access and write data in repositories on GitHub.com using SSH (Secure Shell Protocol). When you connect via SSH, you authenticate using a private key file on your local machine.

For more information about Connect with SSH, see [Authentication / Connect with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh) on GitHub Docs.

#### ‚óè Generate a new SSH key

1. Open `Terminal`.
2. Paste the text below, replacing the email used in the example with your GitHub email address.

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

For more information about it, see [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key) on GitHub Docs.

#### ‚óè Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent

1. Open `Terminal`.
2. Start the ssh-agent in the background.

```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

3. Modify your `~/.ssh/config` file to automatically load keys into the ssh-agent and store passphrases in your keychain.
    3.1. If the file doesn't exist, create the file.
    ```
    touch ~/.ssh/config
    ```

    3.2. Open your `~/.ssh/config` file.
    ```
    open ~/.ssh/config
    ```

    3.3. Modify the file to contain the following lines.
    ```
    Host github.com
      AddKeysToAgent yes
      UseKeychain yes
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ```

4. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent and store your passphrase in the keychain.

```
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

For more information about it, see [Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent) on GitHub Docs.

#### ‚óè Adding a new SSH key to your account

1. OOpen `Terminal`.
2. Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard.

```
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

3. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click ***Settings***.
4. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click ***SSH and GPG keys***.
5. Click ***New SSH key***.
6. In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key.
7. In the "Key" field, paste your public key.
